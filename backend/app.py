#     system = " Using the provided reviews, analyze the product based on the following parameters: ['Performance', 'Camera Quality', 'Battery Life', 'Display', 'Build Quality', 'Value for Money', 'Durability']. For each parameter, provide a comprehensive assessment based on majority sentiment. Do not give a short analysis, make it descriptive. If the majority of reviews are positive, lean the analysis towards a positive consensus. Similarly, if the majority are negative, lean towards a negative consensus. Only indicate a mixed opinion if there is a close balance between positive and negative reviews.  In addition to this, return a list of general pros and cons.  Here's a sample analysis: 'Customers have mixed opinions about the XM4 over-ear headphones in terms of value for money. Many reviewers feel that the premium features, such as excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and comfort, justify the higher price point. However, some users note that there are alternative options available at a lower cost that offer comparable performance. Overall, while many consider the XM4 a worthwhile investment, others suggest weighing personal needs and budget before purchasing.'  Return the analysis as a strict JSON object in this format: {'parameter1': 'analysis_value' 'parameter2': 'analysis_value','pros': ['list_of_pros'],'cons': ['list_of_cons']}  If any parameter lacks relevant data, return 'None' for that parameter.  The reply must be a JSON object only and nothing else."

As an ACE Dominator-Masters player, I can confidently say that this phone offers a stable gaming experience with minimal lag. It handles heavy gaming well, with only occasional lag when the server conditions are poor. The touch response is impressive, making it a solid option for competitive play.The camera quality is surprisingly good, capturing clear and vibrant photos, which is perfect for heavy camera usage. Social media enthusiasts will also appreciate its performance in this area.However, there are a few drawbacks. The phone tends to get quite warm, especially when using the 120Hz refresh rate and full brightness. While this is manageable and doesn't affect the overall experience too much, it‚Äôs something to be aware of. Additionally, the UI stability seems to have taken a hit after the recent update, making the phone feel less enjoyable to use compared to before.Overall, this phone is a strong contender for those who need a device that performs well in gaming, photography, and social media, despite a few minor drawbacks.', 'I have been using this phone since last 1 month and everything this is working fine on an average use of 4-5 hours a day.Battery backup is also good and I usually charge the phone once in 2 days.Camera quality is also good as compared to the price and phone is also fast.Phone Design is fabulous ü§© and it gives you an altogether different feel.Phone weight is equally distributed so doesn't feel heavy while using.', 'This phone is for you if you are looking for a sturdy, smart and practical phone with a neat user experience.

It easily last for 2 days if you are an average user.The only area where phone underperforms is the camera. Despite good specs , the image quality is snot consistent. Colours are often saturated (even after the latest update) and the edge detection in potrait mode is still a struggle. Hopefully Nothing team will roll out more updates to improve and stablize the camera of the phone.Overall, a great product at this price point.', 'this is a good phone, decent processor, extremely good os, decent cameras and if you want to game it doesn't run that hot. However I would appreciated a charger and a bit better specs for this phone. Also would have wished it came with ufs 3.0 but not really a deal breaker for me. Dont use the preapplied screen protector , it is fragile so just get a new one. Tldr: good phone for everyday casual use, get it if you want a good os system, clean phone and fast charging with the nothing gimmicky glyph lighting, go for it Can say it's worth, unless if you only want gaming phone then go for poco x6 pro, sacrificing basically everything expect the processor.', 'Dear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I have received regarding my recent purchase of the Nothing 2A phone. Despite assurances from your mobile inspection team that my concerns would be addressed promptly, I have encountered nothing but frustration and unfulfilled promises.I purchased the Nothing 2A phone expecting a certain standard of quality, particularly in its camera capabilities. Upon realizing the camera did not meet my expectations, I promptly initiated a return request. Despite the initial confirmation from your team, there has been an alarming lack of follow-through on Amazon's part.For over 6-7 days, I patiently waited for a call to arrange the return pick-up, only to receive none. Your application, which I attempted to use for customer service, failed to connect me, highlighting serious deficiencies in its functionality. It took a staggering 10 days of persistent effort via your website before I was finally able to speak with someone.To my disbelief, the response I received was that Amazon could no longer assist with a return or replacement. This level of incompetence and indifference is simply unacceptable from a company of Amazon's stature.My experience with Amazon's handling of this matter has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have been left with a defective product and no recourse for resolution. As a loyal customer who has relied on Amazon for years, this experience has shattered my trust and left me questioning whether I can continue to support your platform.I urge Amazon to seriously reconsider its policies and procedures for handling customer complaints and returns. There needs to be accountability for the promises made to customers and a genuine effort to rectify situations when they fail to meet expectations.In conclusion, I demand a full refund for the Nothing 2A phone and a formal apology for the way this matter has been mishandled. If Amazon hopes to retain my trust and loyalty as a customer, swift action is needed to address these concerns.Sincerely,Sowmya', 'Nothing phone 2a- \u2060- Design: Sleek, transparent; showcases internal components.- **Build Quality: Sturdy and premium feel.- **Display: Bright, vibrant; excellent for media consumption.- **Performance: Smooth and responsive; handles multitasking well.- **Battery Life: Long-lasting; supports fast charging.- **Software: Clean, minimalistic UI; close to stock Android.- **Camera: Decent performance; good in well-lit conditions.- **Unique Features: LED glyph interface; customizable notifications.- **Overall: Distinctive design, solid performance; stands out in a crowded market.', 'Battery life is not good at all .
